# Node-SMS Sending Web App
An SMS sending web app using Node JS, Express JS, SocketIO and Nexmo API

You can send SMS to anyone from this app, the API used in this project is provided by Nexmo, and you have to just use your API Client ID and Secret Key like other APIs.
I have included all the files except one folder ``config`` which has ``index.js`` file, it contains my API key and Secret. You have to make it of your own or just you can write directly on ``App.js`` and use it.
